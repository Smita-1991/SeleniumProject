Relative Xpath: When we find and xpath of specific element without dependant apon parent node called reative xpath

Absolute xpath: we will acutally traverse to the specific element with the help of parent node called relative xpath.

Traverse between sibling:
When the parent is dynamic and 2nd sibling is also dynamic if we want to get the 2nd sibling-> 1st sibling xpath/following-sibling::li[1]
//*[@id='tablist-tab1']/following-sibling::li[1]


When the parent is dynamic:
xpath of sibling/parent::ul
//*[@id='tablist-tab1']/parent::ul


implicit wait: Actually define wait time globaly(Wait for n number of seconds before you throw exception)
Advantage: you are define at globally. It is applicable till the driver instance is active

If implesite wait is 5 sec and page load in 2 seconds it will come out of implesite wait loop and execute next line



Explicit wait

Webdriver wait:webdriver wait is applied for specific element. Webdriver continuosly monitoring screen wheathe r element is present on screen or not
fluent wait: Fluent wait finds the element repeatedly at regular interval of time

Webdriver wait:10 Sec continuosly monitoring screen.
fluent wait:10 Sec monitoring screen at reguller interval of time ie polling time is 4 sec.

Ex. Your card is accepted(displayed in first 3 sec), Your order is being processed( displayed within 7 sec)-confirmation(Note : xpath and id all same of this two element)
In this scenarios we can use fluent wait-> if polling time is 4 sec,Fluent wait find element in 4 sec interval
in first 4 sec fluent wait will monitor the screen and it will search"Your card is accepted", In next 4 it will search"Your order is being processed"
